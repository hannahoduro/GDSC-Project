# 🧬 Drug Sensitivity Analysis Using GDSC Dataset
This project presents a comprehensive analysis of drug response using the **Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC)** dataset. The primary goal was to explore drug efficacy and resistance across various cancer types using sensitivity metrics such as **AUC, IC50, LN_IC50, and Z_SCORE**.
## 📊 Project Objectives
- Identify cancer-type-specific drug responses.
- Explore drug target pathways and their effect on treatment outcomes.
- Discover broad-spectrum anticancer drugs.
- Detect patterns of drug resistance in specific cancers.
- Investigate relationships between sensitivity metrics.
## 🛠️ Key Components
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Statistical Visualization (Histograms, Correlation Heatmaps, Pairplots)
- Insightful observations and conclusions
## 📁 Dataset
- Source: [GDSC Database](https://www.kaggle.com/code/samiraalipour/genomics-of-drug-sensitivity-in-cancer/input?select=GDSC_DATASET.csv)
- Drug response and cancer type information
## 📌 Tools and Libraries
- Python (Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, NumPy)
- Jupyter Notebook
## 📈 Insights
- Cancer types like leukemia exhibit high drug sensitivity.
- Pathways like MAPK are strongly linked to drug resistance.
- LN_IC50 showed the most informative and consistent behavior across analyses.
## ✅ Conclusion
This analysis offers useful insights into drug responses in cancer and can inform future research in personalized medicine.
